How to compile and run:

COMPILE:

for serial: make area.c-serial
for openmp: make area.c-openmp
for mpi: make area.c-mpi
for openmp and mpi: make area.c-mpi-openmp
for all: make all

The make takes in the following options:
NO_X11=1 	for no X windowing
STRIPING=1	for striping activites and inclusion of MPE drawing routines

RUN:
for serial: ./area.c-serial
for openmp: ./area.c-openmp
for mpi: mpirun -np [n] ./area.c-mpi
for mpi-openmp: mpirun -np [n] ./area.c-mpi-openmp

all runs take in the following options:
-n = number of rectangles
-l = left x boundary
-r = right x boundary
-x = 'display' or 'no-display' (without the quotation marks)
-w = 'gap' or 'no-gap' (without the quotation marks) #not needed for striping
