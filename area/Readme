How to compile and run:

COMPILE:
for serial: 
  make area.c-serial
for openmp: 
  make area.c-openmp
for mpi: 
  make area.c-mpi
for openmp and mpi: 
  make area.c-mpi-openmp
for all: 
  make all

The make takes in the following options:
NO_X11=1 	for no X windowing
STAT_KIT=1	for stat kit results

RUN:
for serial:	./area.c-serial
for openmp: 	./area.c-openmp
for mpi: 	mpirun -np [n] ./area.c-mpi
for mpi-openmp: mpirun -np [n] ./area.c-mpi-openmp

all runs take the following options:
-n = number of rectangles
-l = left x boundary of the domain
-r = right x boundary of the domain
-x = 'display' or 'no-display' (without the quotation marks, default is display)
-w = 'gap' or 'no-gap' (without the quotation marks, default is gap)
